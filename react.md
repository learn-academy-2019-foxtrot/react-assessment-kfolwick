2. What are "smart" and "dumb" components? Explain the difference and also add why we bother to make the distinction between them.

  Your answer: Smart components are the components that should house all of the main logic in your program. Dumb components should not hold any logic, it receives all of it's logic from the smart component.

  Researched answer: The dumb component only responsible to present something to DOM. There will be no logic at all inside this component therefore it is called dumb component. The smart component on the other hands keep track of state and concern with how things work. 



3. When we use "yarn add ..." in the terminal - what is yarn doing? And what file will always be automatically updated after we add a package with yarn?

  Your answer: "yarn add" will add packages (such as react package) to your project

  Researched answer: When you want to use a package, you need to add it to your dependencies by usiing "yarn add". This will also update your package.json and your yarn.lock so that other developers working on the project will get the same dependencies as you when they run yarn or yarn install.



4. What is the difference between component state and props? Your answer should include a short explanation of both.

  Your answer: State is an object managed within the smart component. Props are used to pass data from the different components in your program.

  Researched answer: In a React component, props are variables passed to it by its parent component. State on the other hand is still variables, but directly initialized and managed by the component.



5. How would you explain state to a friend who doesn't know code?

  Your answer: State is a piece of data in a web application that can be updated. For example, if a user clicks a button and it turns a different color, the state of the button has been updated.
